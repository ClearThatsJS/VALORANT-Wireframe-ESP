# VALORANT-Wireframe-ESP
This is my aimbot that I coded for the game Valorant. It has aimbot functionality with human aim.
## Requirements
1. Windows 10 or 11 with any versions
2. Installed graphics driver
3. Set enemy highlight color to Purple for better experience
## Safety
You can scan the file with VirusTotal or any antivirus software if you don't trust me.
## Screenshots
